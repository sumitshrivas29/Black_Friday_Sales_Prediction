A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summaries of various customers for selected high-volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city type, stayincurrentcity), product details (productid and product category), and Total purchase amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customers against various products which will help them to create a personalized offer for customers against different products.

I took the dataset from kaggle and made my model to predict the purchase amount of the customers.
for this I have used XGBoost model.
